  abstract="The pretrain-finetune paradigm usually improves downstream performance over training a model from scratch on the same task, becoming commonplace across many areas of machine learning. While pretraining is empirically observed to be beneficial for a range of tasks, there is not a clear understanding yet of the reasons for this effect. In this work, we examine the relationship between pretrained vision transformers and the corresponding finetuned versions on several benchmark datasets and tasks. We present new metrics that specifically investigate the degree to which invariances learned by a pretrained model are retained or forgotten during finetuning. Using these metrics, we present a suite of empirical findings, including that pretraining induces transferable invariances in shallow layers and that invariances from deeper pretrained layers are compressed towards shallower layers during finetuning. Together, these findings contribute to understanding some of the reasons for the successes of pretrained models and the changes that a pretrained model undergoes when finetuned on a downstream task.",

    abstract = "Pretrained language models have been shown to significantly predict brain recordings of people comprehending language. Recent work suggests that the prediction of the next word is a key mechanism that contributes to this alignment. What is not yet understood is whether prediction of the next word is necessary for this observed alignment or simply sufficient, and whether there are other shared mechanisms or information that are similarly important. In this work, we take a step towards understanding the reasons for brain alignment via two simple perturbations in popular pretrained language models. These perturbations help us design contrasts that can control for different types of information. By contrasting the brain alignment of these differently perturbed models, we show that improvements in alignment with brain recordings are due to more than improvements in next-word prediction and word-level information.",

abstract="Continual Learning requires the model to learn from a stream of dynamic, non-stationary data without forgetting previous knowledge. Several approaches have been developed in the literature to tackle the Continual Learning challenge. Among them, Replay approaches have empirically proved to be the most effective ones [16]. Replay operates by saving some samples in memory which are then used to rehearse knowledge during training in subsequent tasks. However, an extensive comparison and deeper understanding of different replay implementation subtleties is still missing in the literature. The aim of this work is to compare and analyze existing replay-based strategies and provide practical recommendations on developing efficient, effective and generally applicable replay-based strategies. In particular, we investigate the role of the memory size value, different weighting policies and discuss about the impact of data augmentation, which allows reaching better performance with lower memory sizes.",
