#  WWrite your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I’m a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org">Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)</a> under the <a href="https://www.cis.mpg.de/cs-max-planck/">CS@max planck</a> program. I am advised by <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/">Krishna Gummadi</a> and I am working with <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mktoneva/">Mariya Toneva</a> in the Bridging AI and Neuroscience Group (BrAIN). My research interests lie at the intersection between Machine Learning and Neuroscience. The goal is to investigate and develop brain-inspired machine learning systems as well as gain a better understanding of how the brain processes information using machine learning methods.

I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Cagliari and my Master's Degree in Computer Science from the University of Pisa.
